# Compressed-Sensing, project completed November 2018
A university project about compressed sensing and iterative thresholding
Source.cpp contains most of the code implementing simple versions of iterative thresholding and gradient descent algorithms, 
whereas mvector.h contains the code defining classes for vectors and matrices. MATH49111....pdf is the report required for the project, 
which provides a study of the theory of these compressed sensing techniques and also contains explanations of my implementation
